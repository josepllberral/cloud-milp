# Datasets from eEnergy'10

Here you can find the data used for modeling and testing the framework presented at ACM eEnergy 2010. This data was obtained from Intel Xeon servers for power measuring, from running the GRID5000 HPC benchmark, and through simulation behavior on the EEFSIM (Energy Efficient Simulator)

## Files
The data here published is a sample from the whole experimentation, as each run provided new metrics. if you want to reproduce the executions, better download the EEFSIM (or set-up your own cluster), and run the Grid5000 using the provided schedules.

### Datasets

* **Models 1**: Data from power consumption for learning Power Consumption, and some EEFSIM execution outputs.
* **Models 2**: Data from the EEFSIM executions and Training Sets for learning SLAs.
* **Models 3**: Data from the EEFSIM executions and Training Sets for learning SLAs.
